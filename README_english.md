 I have been thinking about: do we need to create "Native Language" for communication or recording? Here's some cons about this:

1. It take times to learn. No matter you are a child , a foreigner who try to fit in or a programmer who want to create game, you always need to learn the new language from scratch, which is slow and painful.
